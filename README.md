This repository host the replication code for my MPhil thesis titled 'Trust Legitimacy and Obligation to Obey the Law a Natrual Field Experiment'. 
All data cleaning, manipluation and analysis was conducter in R, and is included within this repository. 

I have utilised several R code snippets originally doveloped ny Dr Chrisoph Nageal at the Universuity of Cologne (see https://osf.io/rpumf/). 
This code has been a highly usefull tool for data processing and visualisation and aspects of his code have been adapted to meet the specific needs of this research.
